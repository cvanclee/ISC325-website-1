    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <p>You need very little personal equipment to play badminton. A racket, sport shoes, and some
    comfortable clothing are typically all that an individual needs. Rackets can run anywhere from $5-$200+, but
    a generally good price range for a racket is $50-$100. Indoor sporting shoes have a similar price range. Birdies
    are generally included at the gym, but a general rule of thumb is to buy Yonex birdies. Plastic
    ones are cheaper and last longer. Feather birdies go faster and hit better, but break easily and are more expensive.
    Feathered birdies are always used at the tournament level, but for practice or recreational play, plastic 
    birdies are generally the better option.</p>
    
    <h2>Where to Play</h2>
    <p>Finding a gym to play in is generally difficult unless you live in a city. Badminton is not
    terribly popular in the United States, and most recreational centers and gyms do not have any 
    equipment for badminton. The best way to find a place to play is to contact your local gyms, look
    online for a local badminton club, or if you are on a campus, check to see if there is a team. <a href="http://www.teamusa.org/usa-badminton/membership/clubs" target="_blank">You
    can also visit this site to see if you live near any official badminton clubs</a></p>
    <p>Another option is to play outside, outdoor badminton setups are usually very cheap and easy to set up.
    However, this is only a good idea if you are not interested in playing competitively. Outdoor play
    is completely different than playing indoors, and is a much less enjoyable experience for serious play.</p>
