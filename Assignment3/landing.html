            <h1>The Game of Badminton</h1>
            <h2>The Rules</h2>
            <p>The rules for playing badminton are surprisingly complex, especially if playing at the 
               tournament/professional level. There are many finer points in the rules that most recreational players 
               have never even heard of, such as 'faults' and 'lets'.
            </p>
            <p>Included <a href="rules">here</a> are two rulebooks; the first
               is a more easy to digest, more compact rule set that would satisfy most recreational players.
               The second is a much more in depth look at the rules of the sport, and covers many more topics,
               such as equipment weight and size, tournament hand gestures and carding, and shuttle speed.
               Even most professional players wouldn't know half of the things included in this book,
               so don't concern yourself too much with memorizing it if you want to start playing.
            </p>
            <h2>The Top Players</h2>
            <p>Here is a list of the ten highest ranked players in the world as of February 23, 2017
               along with their point totals. These lists are for men's and womens's singles. At the top
               of the men's list is Lee Chong Wei
               of Malaysia, who is my personal favorite. His style is much more fun and fluid than most
               other players, making him a pleasure to watch. He is quite old for a professional at 34 years old, so
               we can expect the number one slot to change sooner rather than later. Pictured below are Lee Chong Wei and Tai Tzu Ying.

            <h2>Some Great Matches</h2>
            <p>Badminton isn't really the sort of game you can get
               good at by experiencing second hand, but it can still be fun to watch.
               <a href="videos">Here</a> are some clips from matches between professional players.
