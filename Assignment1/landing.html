    <h1>The Game of Badminton</h1>
    
    <h2>The Rules</h2>
    <p1>The rules for playing badminton are surprisingly complex, especially if playing at the 
      tournament/professional level. There are many finer points in the rules that most recreational players 
      have never even heard of, such as 'faults' and 'lets'.</p1>
      <p2>Included below are two rulebooks; the first
      is a more easy to digest, more compact rule set that would satisfy most recreational players.
      The second is a much more in depth look at the rules of the sport, and covers many more topics,
      such as equipment weight and size, tournament hand gestures and carding, and shuttle speed.
      Even most professional players wouldn't know half of the things included in this book,
      so don't concern yourself too much with memorizing it if you want to start playing.</p2>
    
    <h2>The Top Players</h2>
    
    <h2>Some Great Matches</h2>
    <p1>Badminton isn't really the sort of game you can get
    good at by watching or reading about, but it can still be fun to watch.
    Here are some clips from matches between professional players.</p1>
